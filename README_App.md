## Application Description:
This application is a note taker that starts off with a main landing page. The full functionality of the note taker is displayed after the user clicks on the get started button.

The second page displays the actual note taker application. the left side of the page shows all of the notes that the user has added. The user also has the ability to type in a new title and description in the Note Title and Note Text sections. A save button displays once the user has inputted something in those two sections. If the user clicks on the save icon, the note is then pushed to the left side as the last note on the bottom. The saved input also gets saved as an object in the db.json file, with title, text, and id elements. The plus sign on the top right side clears the two sections and doesn't save changes.
